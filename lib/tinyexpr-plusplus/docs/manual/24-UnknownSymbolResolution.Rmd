# Handling Unknown Variables {#usr}

Although it is possible to add [custom variables](#custom-extensions) to the parser, there may be times when you can't
anticipate the exact variable\index{variables!unknown|see{unknown symbols}} names that a user will enter. For example, a user could enter
variables representing fiscal years in the format of `FY[year]`. From there, they would like to perform operation
such as getting the range between them. In this situation, their expression may be something like this:

```
ABS(FY1999 - FY2009)
```

Here, one could expect the variables `FY1999` and `FY2009` to be treated as `1999` and `2009`, respectively.
By subtracting them (and then taking the absolute value of the result), this should yield `10`. The problem
is that you would need to set up custom variables prior for `FY1999` and `FY2009`.
Even worse, to handle any additional years the user may enter, you would need to create custom
variables for every year possible.

Rather than doing that, you can allow the parser to not recognize these variables as usual.
At this point, it will fall back to a user-defined function that you provide to resolve it.
This is called an "unknown symbol resolver" (USR)\index{unknown symbols!resolving}, and this function will:

- Receive a `std::string_view` of the symbol (i.e., variable name) that the parser failed to recognize
- Determine how to resolve the name
  - If it can resolve it, return a numeric value for the symbol
  - Otherwise, either return `te_parser::te_nan` (i.e., NaN) or throw an exception
  
When your function resolves a symbol, then its name and numeric value will be added to the parser.
Any future evaluations will recognize this name and return the value you previously resolved it to.

::: {.tipsection data-latex=""}
To change the value for a variable that was resolved previously, use `te_parser::set_constant()`.
:::

This function is set up in the parser by passing it to `te_parser::set_unknown_symbol_resolver()` and can
take one of the following signatures:

::: {.minipage data-latex="{\textwidth}"}
```
    double callback(std::string_view);
    double callback(std::string_view, std::string&);
```
:::

The first version will accept the unknown symbol and either return a resolved value or `te_parser::te_nan`.
The second version is the same, except that it also accepts a string reference to write a custom message
to. (This message can later be retrieved by calling `te_parser::get_last_error_message()`.)

::: {.notesection data-latex=""}
If your USR throws a `std::runtime_exception` with an error message in it, then that message
will also be available through `te_parser::get_last_error_message()`.
:::

::: {.minipage data-latex="{\textwidth}"}
`te_parser::set_unknown_symbol_resolver()` can accept either a function pointer or a lambda. 
Here is a simple example using a function:

```cpp
double ResolveResolutionSymbols(std::string_view str)
    {
    // Note that this is case sensitive for brevity.
    return (str == "RES" || str == "RESOLUTION") ?
        96 : te_parser::te_nan;
    }
```
:::

::: {.minipage data-latex="{\textwidth}"}
This can be connected as such:

```cpp
te_parser tep;
tep.set_unknown_symbol_resolver(ResolveResolutionSymbols);

// Will resolve to 288, and "RESOLUTION" will be added as a
// variable to the parser with a value of 96.
// Also, beccause TinyExpr++ is case insensitive,
// "resolution" will also be seen as 96 once "RESOLUTION"
// was resolved.
tep.evaluate("RESOLUTION * 3");
```
:::

::: {.warningsection data-latex=""}
Although TinyExpr++ is case insensitive, it is your USR's responsibility to process
case-insensitively when resolving names. Once a name has been resolved, then the parser
will recognize it case-insensitively in future evaluations.
:::

::: {.minipage data-latex="{\textwidth}"}
The following is an example using a lambda and demonstrates
the fiscal-year-variables scenario mentioned earlier:

```cpp
te_parser tep;

// Create a handler for undefined tokens that will recognize
// dynamic strings like "FY2004" or "FY1997" and convert them to 2004 and 1997.
tep.set_unknown_symbol_resolver(
    // Handler should except a string (which will be the unrecognized token)
    // and return a double.
    [](std::string_view str) -> double
    {
    const std::regex re{ "FY([0-9]{4})",
        std::regex_constants::icase | std::regex_constants::ECMAScript };
    std::smatch matches;
    std::string var{ str };
    if (std::regex_search(var.cbegin(), var.cend(), matches, re))
        {
        // Unrecognized token is something like "FY1982," so extract "1982"
        // from that and return 1982 as a number. At this point, the variable
        // "FY1982" will added to the parser and set to 1982. All future
        // evaluations will see this as 1982 (unless set_constant() is called
        // to change it).
        if (matches.size() > 1)
            { return std::atol(matches[1].str().c_str()); }
        else
            { return te_parser::te_nan; }
        }
    // Can't resolve what this token is, so return NaN.
    else
        { return te_parser::te_nan; }
    });

// Calculate the range between to fiscal years (will be 10):  
tep.evaluate("ABS(FY1999-FY2009)")
```
:::

By default, the parser's USR is a no-op and will not process anything. If you had provided a USR but then
need to turn off this feature, then pass a no-op lambda (e.g., `[]{}`) or no-op object (`te_usr_noop{}`) to `set_unknown_symbol_resolver()`.

Also, once a variable has been resolved by your USR, it will be added as a custom variable with the resolved value assigned to it.
With subsequent evaluations, the previously unrecognized symbols you resolved will be remembered.
This means that it will not to be resolved again and will result in the value that your USR returned from before.

If you prefer to not have resolved symbols added to the parser, then pass `false` to the second parameter to `set_unknown_symbol_resolver()`.
This will force the same unknown symbols to be resolved again with every evaluation.
This can be useful for when your USR's symbol resolutions are dynamic and may change with each call.

::: {.minipage data-latex="{\textwidth}"}
For example, say that an end user will enter variables that start with "STRESS", but you are uncertain what the full name will be.
Additionally, you want to increase the values of these variables with every evaluation. The following demonstrates this:

```cpp
te_parser tep;

tep.set_unknown_symbol_resolver(
    [](std::string_view str) -> double
    {
    static double stressLevel{ 3 };
    if (std::strncmp(str.data(), "STRESS", 6) == 0)
        { return stressLevel++; }
    else
        { return te_parser::te_nan; }
    },
    // purge resolved varialbes after each evaluation
    false);

// Initial resolution of STRESS_LEVEL will be 3.
tep.evaluate("STRESS_LEVEL");
// Because STRESS_LEVEL wasn't kept as a variable (with a value of 3)
// in the parser, then subsequent evaluations will require
// resolving it again:
tep.evaluate("STRESS_LEVEL"); // Will be 4.
tep.evaluate("STRESS_LEVEL"); // 5
tep.evaluate("STRESS_LEVEL"); // 6
```
