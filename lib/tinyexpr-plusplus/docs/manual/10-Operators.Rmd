# Operators

The following operators\index{operators} are supported within math expressions:

::: {.minipage data-latex="{\textwidth}"}
| Operator | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| \* | Multiplication. |
| / | Division. |
| % | Modulus: Divides two values and returns the remainder. |
| + | Addition. |
| \- | Subtraction. |
| ^ | Exponentiation. The number in front of ^ is the base, the number after it is the power to raise it to. |
| ** | Exponentiation. (This is an alias for ^) |
| \= | Equals. |
| < | Less than. |
| \> | Greater than. |
| <> | Not equal to. |
| \!= | Not equal to. (This is an alias for <>) |
| \>= | Greater than or equal to. |
| <= | Less than or equal to. |
| & | Logical conjunction (AND). |
| \| | Logical alternative (OR). |
| ( ) | Groups sub-expressions, overriding the order of operations. |

Table: Operators

::: {.minipage data-latex="{\textwidth}"}
For operators, the order of precedence is:

| Operator | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| ( ) | Instructions in parentheses are executed first. |
| ^   | Exponentiation. |
| \*, /, and % | Multiplication, division, and modulus. |
| \+ and - | Addition and subtraction. |
:::

For example, the following:

$$
5+5+5/2
$$

Will yield `12.5`. `5/2` is executed first, then added to the other fives. However, by using parentheses:

$$
(5+5+5)/2
$$

You can override it so that the additions happen first (resulting in `15`), followed by the division (finally yielding `7.5`).
Likewise, `(2+5)^2` will yield `49` (`7` squared), while `2+5^2` will yield `27` (`5` squared, plus `2`).

## Compatability Note {-}

The `%` character acts as a modulus operator in *TinyExpr++*, which is different from most
spreadsheet programs. In programs such as *LibreOffice Calc* and *Excel*, `%` is used
to convert a number to a percentage. For example, `=20%` would yield `0.20` in Excel.
In *TinyExpr++*, however, `20%` will result in a syntax error as
it is expecting a binary (modulus) operation.
