# Overview

This is the programming manual for *TinyExpr++*, the C++ version of the *TinyExpr* [@TinyExpr] formula parsing library. (This manual includes documentation from *TinyExpr* by Lewis Van Winkle.)

*TinyExpr++* is a small parser and evaluation library for solving math expressions from C++.
It's open-source, free, easy-to-use, and self-contained in a single source and header file pair.

## Features {-}

- C++17 with no dependencies.
- Single source file and header file.
- Simple and fast.
- Implements standard operator precedence.
- Implements logical and comparison operators.
- Exposes standard C math functions (`sin`, `sqrt`, `ln`, etc.), as well as some *Excel*-like functions (e.g., `AVERAGE()` and `IF()`).
- Can add custom functions and variables easily.
- Can add a custom handler to resolve unknown variables.
- Can bind constants at eval-time.
- Supports variadic functions (taking between 1-7 arguments).
- Case insensitive.
- Supports non-US formulas (e.g., `POW(2,2; 2)` instead of `POW(2.2, 2)`).
- Supports C and C++ style comments within math expressions.
- Released under the zlib license - free for nearly any use.
- Easy to use and integrate with your code.
- Thread-safe; parser is in a self-contained object.
